						<p>Gothic architecture is an architectural style that was prevalent in Europe from the late 12th to the 16th
							century, during the High and Late Middle Ages, surviving into the 17th and 18th centuries in some areas.
							It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. It originated in
							the Île-de-France and Picardy regions of northern France. The style at the time was sometimes known as
							opus Francigenum (lit. 'French work'); the term Gothic was first applied contemptuously during the later
							Renaissance, by those ambitious to revive the architecture of classical antiquity.
							<br><br>
							The defining design element of Gothic architecture is the pointed or ogival arch. The use of the pointed
							arch in turn led to the development of the pointed rib vault and flying buttresses, combined with
							elaborate tracery and stained glass windows.
							<br><br>
							At the Abbey of Saint-Denis, near Paris, the choir was reconstructed between 1140 and 1144, drawing
							together for the first time the developing Gothic architectural features. In doing so, a new architectural
							style emerged that emphasized verticality and the effect created by the transmission of light through
							stained glass windows.
							<br><br>
							Common examples are found in Christian ecclesiastical architecture, and Gothic cathedrals and churches, as
							well as abbeys, and parish churches. It is also the architecture of many castles, palaces, town halls,
							guildhalls, universities and, less prominently today, private dwellings. Many of the finest examples of
							medieval Gothic architecture are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.

						<p>Gothic architecture is also known as ogival architecture. Medieval contemporaries described the style as
							Latin: opus Francigenum, lit. 'French work' or 'Frankish work', as opus modernum, 'modern work', novum
							opus, 'new work', or as Italian: maniera tedesca, lit. 'German style'.
							<br><br>
							The term "Gothic architecture" originated as a pejorative description. Giorgio Vasari used the term
							"barbarous German style" in his Lives of the Artists to describe what is now considered the Gothic style,
							and in the introduction to the Lives he attributes various architectural features to the Goths, whom he
							held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered Rome, and erecting new ones in
							this style. Thus the Gothic style, being in opposition to classical architecture, from that point of view
							was associated with the destruction of advancement and sophistication. The assumption that classical
							architecture was better than Gothic architecture was widespread and proved difficult to defeat. Vasari was
							echoed in the 16th century by François Rabelais, who referred to Goths and Ostrogoths (Gotz and
							Ostrogotz).

						<p>The Gothic style of architecture was strongly influenced by the Romanesque architecture which preceded
							it; by the growing population and wealth of European cities, and by the desire to express local grandeur.
							It was influenced by theological doctrines which called for more light and by technical improvements in
							vaults and buttresses that allowed much greater height and larger windows. It was also influenced by the
							necessity of many churches, such as Chartres Cathedral and Canterbury Cathedral, to accommodate growing
							numbers of pilgrims. It adapted features from earlier styles, such as Islamic architecture. According to
							Charles Texier (French historian, architect, and archaeologist) and Josef Strzygowski (Polish-Austrian art
							historian), after lengthy research and study of cathedrals in the medieval city of Ani, the capital of the
							medieval kingdom of Armenia concluded to have discovered the oldest Gothic arch.

						<p>Architecture "became a leading form of artistic expression during the late Middle Ages". Gothic
							architecture began in the earlier 12th century in northwest France and England and spread throughout Latin
							Europe in the 13th century; by 1300, a first "international style" of Gothic had developed, with common
							design features and formal language. A second "international style" emerged by 1400, alongside innovations
							in England and central Europe that produced both the perpendicular and flamboyant varieties. Typically,
							these typologies are identified as:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="puncte">c.1130-c.1240 Early to High Gothic and Early English</li>
							<li class="puncte">c.1240-c.1350 Rayonnant and Decorated Style</li>
							<li class="puncte">c.1350-c.1500 Late Gothic: flamboyant and perpendicular</li>
							<li class="puncte">c.16th-18th century Post-Gothic</li>
