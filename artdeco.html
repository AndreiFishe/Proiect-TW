							Art Deco, short for the French Arts décoratifs (lit. 'Decorative Arts'), is a style of visual arts,
							architecture, and product design, that first appeared in Paris in the 1910s (just before World War I),
							and flourished in the United States and Europe during the 1920s to early 1930s. Through styling and design
							of the exterior and interior of anything from large structures to small objects, including how people look
							(clothing, fashion, and jewelry), Art Deco has influenced bridges, buildings (from skyscrapers to
							cinemas), ships, ocean liners, trains, cars, trucks, buses, furniture, and everyday objects including
							radios and vacuum cleaners.
							<br><br>
							Art Deco got its name after the 1925 Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes
							(International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris. Art Deco combined
							the styles of early 20th century Modernist avant-garde, with the fine craftsmanship and rich materials of
							French historic design, but also sometimes with motifs taken from non-Western cultures. <br><br>From its
							outset, Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of Cubism and the Vienna Secession; the bright
							colours of Fauvism and of the Ballets Russes; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of
							Louis XVI and Louis Philippe I; and the exoticized styles of art from China, Japan, India, Persia, ancient
							Egypt and Maya.
							<br><br>
							During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological
							progress. The movement featured rare and expensive materials, such as ebony and ivory, and exquisite
							craftsmanship. In New York, the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and other buildings from the
							1920s and 1930s are monuments to the style.
							<br><br>
							In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, Art Deco gradually became more subdued, paving the way for the
							International Style and Mid-century modern. New materials arrived, including chrome plating, stainless
							steel and plastic. A sleeker form of the style, called Streamline Moderne, appeared in the 1930s,
							featuring curving forms and smooth, polished surfaces. Art Deco was a truly international style, but
							its dominance ended with the beginning of World War II and the rise of the strictly functional and
							unadorned styles of modern architecture and the International Style of architecture that followed.
							<br><br>
							Art Deco took its name, short for Arts Décoratifs, from the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative
							and Industrial Arts held in Paris in 1925, though the diverse styles that characterised it had already
							appeared in Paris and Brussels before World War I.

						<p>New materials and technologies, especially reinforced concrete, were key to the development and
							appearance of Art Deco. The first concrete house was built in 1853 in the Paris suburbs by François
							Coignet. In 1877 Joseph Monier introduced the idea of strengthening the concrete with a mesh of iron rods
							in a grill pattern. In 1893, Auguste Perret built the first concrete garage in Paris, then an apartment
							building, house, then, in 1913, the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. The theatre was denounced by one critic as
							the "Zeppelin of Avenue Montaigne", an alleged Germanic influence, copied from the Vienna Secession.
							Thereafter, the majority of Art Deco buildings were made of reinforced concrete, which gave greater
							freedom of form and less need for reinforcing pillars and columns. Perret was also a pioneer in covering
							the concrete with ceramic tiles, both for protection and decoration. The architect Le Corbusier first
							learned the uses of reinforced concrete working as a draftsman in Perret's studio.
							<br><br>
							Other new technologies that were important to Art Deco were new methods in producing plate glass, which
							was less expensive and allowed much larger and stronger windows, and for mass-producing aluminium, which
							was used for building and window frames and later, by Corbusier, Warren McArthur, and others, for
							lightweight furniture.

						<p>In 1925, two different competing schools coexisted within Art Deco: the traditionalists, who had founded
							the Society of Decorative Artists; included the furniture designer Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, Jean Dunand,
							the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, and designer Paul Poiret; they combined modern forms with traditional
							craftsmanship and expensive materials. On the other side were the modernists, who increasingly rejected
							the past and wanted a style based upon advances in new technologies, simplicity, a lack of decoration,
							inexpensive materials, and mass production. The modernists founded their own organisation, The French
							Union of Modern Artists, in 1929. Its members included architects Pierre Chareau, Francis Jourdain, Robert
							Mallet-Stevens, Corbusier, and, in the Soviet Union, Konstantin Melnikov; the Irish designer Eileen Gray;
							the French designer Sonia Delaunay; and the jewellers Georges Fouquet and Jean Puiforcat. They fiercely
							attacked the traditional art deco style, which they said was created only for the wealthy, and insisted
							that well-constructed buildings should be available to everyone, and that form should follow function. The
							beauty of an object or building resided in whether it was perfectly fit to fulfil its function. Modern
							industrial methods meant that furniture and buildings could be mass-produced, not made by hand.
							<br><br>
							The Art Deco interior designer Paul Follot defended Art Deco in this way: "We know that man is never
							content with the indispensable and that the superfluous is always needed...If not, we would have to get
							rid of music, flowers, and perfumes..!" However, Le Corbusier was a brilliant publicist for modernist
							architecture; he stated that a house was simply "a machine to live in", and tirelessly promoted the idea
							that Art Deco was the past and modernism was the future. Le Corbusier's ideas were gradually adopted by
							architecture schools, and the aesthetics of Art Deco were abandoned. The same features that made Art Deco
							popular in the beginning, its craftsmanship, rich materials and ornament, led to its decline. The Great
							Depression that began in the United States in 1929, and reached Europe shortly afterwards, greatly reduced
							the number of wealthy clients who could pay for the furnishings and art objects. In the Depression
							economic climate, few companies were ready to build new skyscrapers. Even the Ruhlmann firm resorted to
							producing pieces of furniture in series, rather than individual hand-made items. The last buildings built
							in Paris in the new style were the Museum of Public Works by Auguste Perret (now the French Economic,
							Social and Environmental Council), the Palais de Chaillot by Louis-Hippolyte Boileau, Jacques Carlu and
							Léon Azéma, and the Palais de Tokyo of the 1937 Paris International Exposition; they looked out at the
							grandiose pavilion of Nazi Germany, designed by Albert Speer, which faced the equally grandiose
							socialist-realist pavilion of Stalin's Soviet Union.
							<br><br>
							After World War II, the dominant architectural style became the International Style pioneered by Le
							Corbusier, and Mies van der Rohe. A handful of Art Deco hotels were built in Miami Beach after World War
							II, but elsewhere the style largely vanished, except in industrial design, where it continued to be used
							in automobile styling and products such as jukeboxes. In the 1960s, it experienced a modest academic
							revival, thanks in part to the writings of architectural historians such as Bevis Hillier. In the 1970s
							efforts were made in the United States and Europe to preserve the best examples of Art Deco architecture,
							and many buildings were restored and repurposed. Postmodern architecture, which first appeared in the
							1980s, like Art Deco, often includes purely decorative features. Deco continues to inspire designers, and
							is often used in contemporary fashion, jewellery, and toiletries.
