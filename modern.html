							Modern architecture emerged at the end of the 19th century from revolutions in technology, engineering,
							and building materials, and from a desire to break away from historical architectural styles and invent
							something that was purely functional and new.
							<br><br>
							The revolution in materials came first, with the use of cast iron, drywall, plate glass, and reinforced
							concrete, to build structures that were stronger, lighter, and taller. The cast plate glass process was
							invented in 1848, allowing the manufacture of very large windows. The Crystal Palace by Joseph Paxton at
							the Great Exhibition of 1851 was an early example of iron and plate glass construction, followed in 1864
							by the first glass and metal curtain wall. These developments together led to the first steel-framed
							skyscraper, the ten-story Home Insurance Building in Chicago, built in 1884 by William Le Baron Jenney
							and based on the works of Viollet le Duc.
							<br><br>
							French industrialist François Coignet was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete, that is, concrete
							strengthened with iron bars, as a technique for constructing buildings. In 1853 Coignet built the first
							iron reinforced concrete structure, a four-storey house in the suburbs of Paris. A further important
							step forward was the invention of the safety elevator by Elisha Otis, first demonstrated at the New York
							Crystal Palace exposition in 1854, which made tall office and apartment buildings practical. Another
							important technology for the new architecture was electric light, which greatly reduced the inherent
							danger of fires caused by gas in the 19th century.
							<br><br>
							Modern architecture, also called modernist architecture, was an architectural movement and style that was
							prominent in the 20th century, between the earlier Art Deco and later postmodern movements. Modern
							architecture was based upon new and innovative technologies of construction (particularly the use of
							glass, steel, and concrete); the principle functionalism (i.e. that form should follow function); an
							embrace of minimalism; and a rejection of ornament.
							<br><br>
							According to Le Corbusier, the roots of the movement were to be found in the works of Eugène Viollet le
							duc. The movement emerged in the first half of the 20th century and became dominant after World War II
							until the 1980s, when it was gradually replaced as the principal style for institutional and corporate
							buildings by postmodern architecture.
							<br><br>
							The debut of new materials and techniques inspired architects to break away from the neoclassical and
							eclectic models that dominated European and American architecture in the late 19th century, most notably
							eclecticism, Victorian and Edwardian architecture, and the Beaux-Arts architectural style. This break
							with the past was particularly urged by the architectural theorist and historian Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In
							his 1872 book Entretiens sur L'Architecture, he urged: "use the means and knowledge given to us by our
							times, without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can
							inaugurate a new architecture. For each function its material; for each material its form and its
							ornament." This book influenced a generation of architects, including Louis Sullivan, Victor Horta,
							Hector Guimard, and Antoni Gaudí.

						<p>At the end of the 19th century, the first skyscrapers began to appear in the United States. They were a
							response to the shortage of land and high cost of real estate in the center of the fast-growing American
							cities, and the availability of new technologies, including fireproof steel frames and improvements in the
							safety elevator invented by Elisha Otis in 1852. The first steel-framed "skyscraper", The Home Insurance
							Building in Chicago, was ten stories high. It was designed by William Le Baron Jenney in 1883, and was
							briefly the tallest building in the world. Louis Sullivan built another monumental new structure, the
							Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building, in the heart of Chicago in 1904–1906. While these buildings
							were revolutionary in their steel frames and height, their decoration was borrowed from Neo-Renaissance,
							Neo-Gothic and Beaux-Arts architecture. The Woolworth Building, designed by Cass Gilbert, was completed in
							1912, and was the tallest building in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in 1929. The
							structure was purely modern, but its exterior was decorated with Neo-Gothic ornament, complete with
							decorative buttresses, arches and spires, which caused it to be nicknamed the "Cathedral of Commerce".
