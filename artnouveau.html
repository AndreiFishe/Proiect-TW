						<p>Art Nouveau is an international style of art, architecture, and applied art, especially the decorative
							arts. It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers. Other
							characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement, often given by asymmetry or whiplash
							lines, and the use of modern materials, particularly iron, glass, ceramics and later concrete, to create
							unusual forms and larger open spaces. It was popular between 1890 and 1910 during the Belle Époque period,
							and was a reaction against the academicism, eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and
							decorative art.
							<br><br>
							One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional distinction between fine arts
							(especially painting and sculpture) and applied arts. It was most widely used in interior design, graphic
							arts, furniture, glass art, textiles, ceramics, jewellery and metal work. The style responded to leading
							19-century theoreticians, such as French architect Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814-1879) and British
							art critic John Ruskin (1819-1900). In Britain, it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and
							Crafts
							movement. German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk ('total work of
							art') that would unify the architecture, furnishings, and art in the interior in a common style, to uplift
							and inspire the residents.
							<br><br>
							The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s, in the
							architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar, Henry van de Velde, and especially
							Victor Horta, whose Hôtel Tassel was completed in 1893. It moved quickly to Paris, where it was adapted by
							Hector Guimard, who saw Horta's work in Brussels and applied the style to the entrances of the new Paris
							Métro. It reached its peak at the 1900 Paris International Exposition, which introduced the Art Nouveau
							work of artists such as Louis Tiffany. It appeared in graphic arts in the posters of Alphonse Mucha, and
							the glassware of René Lalique and Émile Gallé.
							<br><br>
							From Britain, Belgium and France, Art Nouveau spread to the rest of Europe, taking on different names and
							characteristics in each country (see Naming section below). It often appeared not only in capitals, but
							also in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic identities (Turin and Palermo in Italy;
							Glasgow in Scotland; Munich and Darmstadt in Germany; Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain), as well as in
							centres of independence movements (Helsinki in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire).
							<br><br>
							By 1914, with the beginning of the First World War, Art Nouveau was largely exhausted. In the 1920s, it
							was replaced as the dominant architectural and decorative art style by Art Deco and then Modernism. The
							Art Nouveau style began to receive more positive attention from critics in the late 1960s, with a major
							exhibition of the work of Hector Guimard at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970.
							<br><br>
							The term Art Nouveau was first used in the 1880s in the Belgian journal L'Art Moderne to describe the work
							of Les Vingt, twenty painters and sculptors seeking reform through art. The name was popularized by the
							Maison de l'Art Nouveau ('House of the New Art'), an art gallery opened in Paris in 1895 by the
							Franco-German art dealer Siegfried Bing. In Britain, the French term Art Nouveau was commonly used, while
							in France, it was often called by the term Style moderne (akin to the British term Modern Style), or Style
							1900.In France, it was also sometimes called Style Jules Verne (after the novelist Jules Verne), Style
							Métro (after Hector Guimard's iron and glass subway entrances), Art Belle Époque, or Art fin de siècle.
							<br><br>
							Art Nouveau is known by different names in different languages: Jugendstil in German, Stile Liberty in
							Italian, Modernisme in Catalan, and also known as the Modern Style in English. The style is often related
							to, but not always identical with, styles that emerged in many countries in Europe and elsewhere at about
							the same time. Their local names were often used in their respective countries to describe the whole
							movement.

						<p>Following the 1900 Exposition, the capital of Art Nouveau was Paris. The most extravagant residences in
							the style were built by Jules Lavirotte, who entirely covered the façades with ceramic sculptural
							decoration. The most flamboyant example is the Lavirotte Building, at 29, avenue Rapp (1901). Office
							buildings and department stores featured high courtyards covered with stained glass cupolas and ceramic
							decoration. The style was particularly popular in restaurants and cafés, including Maxim's at 3, rue
							Royale, and Le Train bleu at the Gare de Lyon (1900).
							<br><br>
							The status of Paris attracted foreign artists to the city. The Swiss-born artist Eugène Grasset was one of
							the first creators of French Art Nouveau posters. He helped decorate the famous cabaret Le Chat Noir in
							1885, made his first posters for the Fêtes de Paris and a celebrated poster of Sarah Bernhardt in 1890. In
							Paris, he taught at the Guérin school of art (École normale d'enseignement du dessin), where his students
							included Augusto Giacometti and Paul Berthon. Swiss-born Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen created the
							famous poster for the Paris cabaret Le Chat noir in 1896. The Czech artist Alphonse Mucha (1860-1939)
							arrived in Paris in 1888, and in 1895, made a poster for actress Sarah Bernhardt in the play Gismonda by
							Victorien Sardou in Théâtre de la Renaissance. The success of this poster led to a contract to produce
							posters for six more plays by Bernhardt.

				<h2>Art Nouveau in Belgium</h2>
				<hr>
				<div class="containerNordul">
					<div>
						<p>Belgium was an early centre of Art Nouveau, thanks largely to the architecture of Victor Horta, who
							designed one of the first Art Nouveau houses, the Hôtel Tassel in 1893, and three other townhouses in
							variations of the same style. They are now UNESCO World Heritage sites. Horta had a strong influence on
							the work of the young Hector Guimard, who came to see the Hôtel Tassel under construction, and later
							declared that Horta was the "inventor" of the Art Nouveau. Horta's innovation was not the façade, but
							the interior, using an abundance of iron and glass to open up space and flood the rooms with light, and
							decorating them with wrought iron columns and railings in curving vegetal forms, which were echoed on the
							floors and walls, as well as the furniture and carpets which Horta designed.
