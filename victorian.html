						<p>Victorian architecture is a series of architectural revival styles in the mid-to-late 19th century.
							Victorian refers to the reign of Queen Victoria (1837–1901), called the Victorian era, during which period
							the styles known as Victorian were used in construction. However, many elements of what is typically
							termed "Victorian" architecture did not become popular until later in Victoria's reign, roughly from 1850
							and later. The styles often included interpretations and eclectic revivals of historic styles (see
							Historicism). The name represents the British and French custom of naming architectural styles for a
							reigning monarch. Within this naming and classification scheme, it followed Georgian architecture and
							later Regency architecture and was succeeded by Edwardian architecture.
							<br><br>
							Although Victoria did not reign over the United States, the term is often used for American styles and
							buildings from the same period, as well as those from the British Empire.
							During the 18th century, a few English architects emigrated to the colonies, but as the British Empire
							became firmly established during the 19th century, many architects emigrated at the start of their
							careers. Some chose the United States, and others went to Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Normally,
							they applied architectural styles that were fashionable when they left England. By the latter half of the
							century, however, improving transport and communications meant that even remote parts of the Empire had
							access to publications such as the magazine The Builder, which helped colonial architects keep informed
							about current fashion. Thus, the influence of English architecture spread across the world. Several
							prominent architects produced English-derived designs around the world, including William Butterfield (St
							Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide) and Jacob Wrey Mould (Chief Architect of Public Works in New York City).

							<br><br>
							The Victorian period flourished in Australia and is generally recognised as being from 1840 to 1890, which
							saw a gold rush and population boom during the 1880s in the states of New South Wales and Victoria.

							<br><br>
							In the United States, 'Victorian' architecture generally describes styles that were most popular between
							1860 and 1900. A list of these styles most commonly includes Second Empire (1855–85), Stick-Eastlake
							(1860–c. 1890), Folk Victorian (1870–1910), Queen Anne (1880–1910), Richardsonian Romanesque (1880–1900),
							and Shingle (1880–1900). As in the United Kingdom, examples of Gothic Revival and Italianate continued to
							be constructed during this period and are therefore sometimes called Victorian. Some historians classify
							the later years of Gothic Revival as a distinctive Victorian style named High Victorian Gothic.
							Stick-Eastlake, a manner of geometric, machine-cut decorating derived from Stick and Queen Anne, is
							sometimes considered a distinct style. On the other hand, terms such as "Painted Ladies" or "gingerbread"
							may be used to describe certain Victorian buildings, but do not constitute a specific style. The names of
							architectural styles (as well as their adaptations) varied between countries. Many homes combined the
							elements of several different styles and are not easily distinguishable as one particular style or
							another.

						<p>During the early 19th century, the romantic medieval Gothic Revival style was developed as a reaction to
							the symmetry of Palladianism, and such buildings as Fonthill Abbey were built.

							By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new technology, construction was able to incorporate
							metal materials as building components. Structures were erected with cast iron and wrought iron frames.
							However, due to being weak in tension, these materials were effectively phased out in place for more
							structurally sound steel. One of the greatest exponents of iron frame construction was Joseph Paxton,
							architect of the Crystal Palace. Paxton also continued to build such houses as Mentmore Towers, in the
							still popular English Renaissance styles. New methods of construction were developed in this era of
							prosperity, but ironically the architectural styles, as developed by such architects as Augustus Pugin,
							were typically retrospective.

				<h2>Victorian architecture in India</h2>

					<div>
						<p>Because India was a colony of Britain, Victorian Architecture is prevalent in India, Especially in cities
							like Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, In Mumbai (Formerly called Bombay) buildings like Municipal Corporation
							Building, Bombay University, Bombay High Court, Asiatic Society of Mumbai Building (Former Town Hall) and
							the David Sasoon Library are some example of Victorian Architecture in Mumbai. In Kolkata (Formerly called
							Calcutta) buildings like the Victoria Memorial, Calcutta High Court, St Paul's Cathedral, The Asiatic
							Society of Bengal are some examples of Victorian Architecture in Kolkata. In Chennai (Formerly called
							Madras) some examples include Madras High court, State Bank of Madras and St. Mary's Church.
							<br><br>Efforts to preserve landmarks of Victorian architecture are ongoing and are often led by the
							Victorian Society. A recent campaign the group has taken on is the preservation of Victorian gasometers
							after utility companies announced plans to demolish nearly 200 of the now-outdated structures.
